### Glossary

Description of Metrics:

* <b>Time Average Lead</b>:
  * At any give point in regulation in the 2022 season, team ___ led by an average of ___ points.
* <b>Yards/Snap</b>:
  * Average yards/snap gained (or allowed) by team's offense (or defense)
  * Includes penalty accepted yards
  * Does not consider spikes/kneel downs/special teams plays
* <b>Adjusted Yards/Snap</b>:
  * [Empirical Bayes (shrinkage) Estimate](https://caseycaprini.github.io/the_latest_numbers/posts/2022-09-12-nfl-basic-multilevel-models/) of average yards/snap gained (or allowed) by team's offense (or defense)
