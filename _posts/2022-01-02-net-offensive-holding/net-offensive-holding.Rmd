## Motivating questions

Through the black-and-gold colored glasses of a Steelers fan, it seemed like offensive holding calls basically were not called in 2020 (I can't watch as much of other games as I'd like).  

I had been wondering how much a lack of holding calls may have negatively impacted the 2020 Steelers defense.

* How crippling is a holding call to a drive?
* Which teams have taken the most offensive holding penalties?
* Which teams have drawn the most offensive holding calls?
* Which teams draw the most holds while committing the fewest (i.e., drawn - taken = net holds drawn)?

Recently, [Matt Williamson](https://twitter.com/WilliamsonNFL) wondered aloud whether more holds occur on run or pass plays on an episode of [SNR: The Drive](https://player.fm/series/snr-drive-with-matt-dale-pittsburgh-steelers).

## Method

Using play-by-play data via [nflfastR](https://www.nflfastr.com/index.html):

* Throw out punt and kickoffs
* Count all holds called, even if declined or offset by another penalty
* If not directly identified as a pass or run in the data set, infer whether the play call was a pass or run using keywords in the play description.
  * Sacks were counted as "pass" play calls.
  * Scrambles were also counted as play calls.

This is just amateur stuff for fun. I'm probably classifying some play calls incorrectly. I did a quick cross-check of total holding calls for 2021 against this [website](https://www.nflpenalties.com/penalty/offensive-holding?year=2021), and the results were tracking (it looks like the website includes special teams holds, whereas I threw them out).

## Results for 2021, Through Week 16

#### Affect on series conversion rates

[Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) periodically post team series conversion rates, where a series is a success if it generates a new set of downs or scores a TD. Here's a [recent example](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin/status/1473655366806392835).

* Typical series conversion rates for an offense are in the neighborhood of 70 percent.
* When an offense commits a holding penalty, the <b>series conversion rate drops to ```r hold_series_success_rate``` percent</b> in 2021.

#### Defense offensive holding calls drawn ranks

#### Offensive holds by play call

Through Week 16, ```r run_hold_prop``` percent of all Offensive Holds have occurred on run plays.

## Conclusion

This was a quick, interesting exercise.

An offensive holding call really does hurt a drive as much as it seems.

In the future, it would be interesting to look at the topic in more detail. For example, more holds were called on run plays (~54 percent) than pass plays in 2020, the opposite of 2021. Is there a trend in officiating, change in play call mix, or just random variation?
