## Intro

The following is a collection of team summary statistics for the 2021 season.

For all of these statistics, the basic unit is the time average lead (regulation time only, in either points or possessions) for the 17 regular season games played in 2021.

For an introduction to time averages, check [this](https://caseycaprini.github.io/the_latest_numbers/posts/2021-11-28-time-average-nfl-metrics/) out.

  * Season time average lead with adjustment for opponent quality
    * TALE = TAL + SoS
  * Units: Points
* <b>TAL</b>: <u>T</u>ime <u>A</u>verage <u>L</u>ead
  * Unadjusted time average lead for regulation time of all regular season games.
    * At any give point in regulation of 2021, team __ led by an average of __ points.
  * Units: Points
* <b>SoS</b>: <u>S</u>trength <u>o</u>f <u>S</u>chedule
  * Opponent quality adjustment based on opponents' average TAL of opponents time average lead
  * Does not consider games against team of interest
