## Intro

The following is a collection of team summary statistics for the 2021 season.

For all of these statistics, the basic unit is the time average lead (regulation time only, in either points or possessions) for the 17 regular season games played in 2021.

For an introduction to time averages, check [this](https://caseycaprini.github.io/the_latest_numbers/posts/2021-11-28-time-average-nfl-metrics/) out.
