## Two Measures of Win 'Luck'

This post takes a look at two estimates of win luck, or roughly, actual record compared with "expected" record.

First, Pythagorean Win Expectation. I'll use the [Daryl Morey formulation](https://grantland.com/features/breaking-best-nfl-stats/), which built on Bill James's work for baseball. The basic logic of Pythagorean Win Expectation is as follows: total points scored and allowed for an entire regular season are more reliable indicator of "true" ability than the sum of individual game outcomes (i.e., win/loss/tie). Thus, I think of Pythagorean Win Expectation as an <i>across game estimate</i> of expected regular season record.

Second, I'll use my time average lead concept. This approach estimates the expected win percentage for each individual game, and estimates expected wins for a season using the sum of these individual game expected win percentage estimates. Since the estimation is done at the individual game level, I'll call this a <i>within game estimate</i>.

### Time Average Win Expectancy Model

The code below fits a logistic model to the 2015 to 2021 regular seasons.

```{r, message=FALSE}

train <- map_dfr(
  2015:2021,
  nfl_mvt_season) %>%
  filter(home_away == "home")

train_results <- load_pbp(2015:2021) %>%
  filter(season_type == "REG") %>%
  mutate(home_result = case_when(
    result > 0 ~ "Win",
    result == 0 ~ "Tie",
    result < 0 ~ "Loss"
  )) %>%
  group_by(game_id) %>%
  summarize(
    season = season,
    week = week,
    team = home_team,
    opponent = away_team,
    result = home_result,
    .groups = "drop") %>%
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(game_id = NULL)

train_df <- left_join(
  train,
  train_results) %>%
  filter(result != "Tie") %>%
  filter(home_away == "home") %>%
  mutate(
    result = ifelse(
      result == "Win",
      1L, 0L),
    home_away = as.factor(home_away)
  )

model <- rstanarm::stan_glm(
  result ~ -1 + time_avg_lead,
  data = train_df,
  family = "binomial",
  refresh = 0
)

test <- nfl_mvt_season(2022)

beta <- coef(model)

test_df <- test %>%
  mutate(exp_wp = 1/(1 + exp(-beta * time_avg_lead)))

df_2022 <- test_df %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarize(exp_wp = mean(exp_wp, na.rm = T),
            .groups = "drop")

```

### Pythagorean Win Expectancy

Next, I assemble the information to calculate the Pythagorean Win Expectation, Actual Wins, and the tow "Win Luck" estimates.

```{r}

home_2022 <- load_pbp(2022) %>%
  filter(season_type == "REG") %>%
  group_by(game_id) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(home_win = ifelse(result > 0,
                           1L, 0L)) %>%
  group_by(home_team) %>%
  summarize(games_played = n(),
            points_scored = sum(home_score),
            points_allowed = sum(away_score),
            wins = sum(home_win),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  rename(team = home_team)

away_2022 <- load_pbp(2022) %>%
  filter(season_type == "REG") %>%
  group_by(game_id) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(away_win = ifelse(result < 0,
                           1L, 0L)) %>%
  group_by(away_team) %>%
  summarize(games_played = n(),
            points_scored = sum(away_score),
            points_allowed = sum(home_score),
            wins = sum(away_win),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  rename(team = away_team)

team_2022 <- rbind(
  home_2022,
  away_2022) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  summarize(
    games_played = sum(games_played),
    points_scored = sum(points_scored),
    points_allowed = sum(points_allowed),
    wins = sum(wins),
    .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(actual_wp = wins/games_played,
         pythag_wp = (points_scored ^ 2.37)/((points_scored ^ 2.37) + (points_allowed) ^ 2.37)) %>%
  left_join(df_2022) %>%
  mutate(time_avg_win_luck = (actual_wp - exp_wp) * 17,
         pythag_win_luck = (actual_wp - pythag_wp) * 17)

```

Note, the "actual" wins for BUF and CIN are estimates too, in that their 16 game win percentage is extrapolated to 17 games to calculate actual wins.

## Model Summary

The summary for the time average win expectation model:

```{r}

summary(model,
        digits = 3)

```

## Plot

```{r}

  theme_light()
