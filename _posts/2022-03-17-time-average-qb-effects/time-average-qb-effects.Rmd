## Intro

Past posts have explored uses of [NFL time average leads as a single-point summary of overall game performance](https://caseycaprini.github.io/the_latest_numbers/posts/2021-11-28-time-average-nfl-metrics/).

Using a simple logistic regression model, I looked at [2021 regular season win luck](https://caseycaprini.github.io/the_latest_numbers/posts/2022-01-28-2021-nfl-regular-season-win-luck/). Notably, the "luckiest teams" had veteran/high quality QBs.

My intuition: quality QBs perform well in comeback and high leverage situations. The residuals from the single feature model reflect that the direct effect of QBs is significant.

Here, I expand the model to include QB quality, using an approach inspired by Mike Sando's QB Tiers.

## Mike Sando's QB Tiers

Mike Sando is probably my favorite national NFL writer. He's one of a few writers that make me a subscriber to the Athletic. His [recent tribute to the late John Clayton](https://theathletic.com/3198705/2022/03/21/john-clayton-espn-nfl-death/) was tremendous.

Each summer since 2014, Sando has released his QB Tier article, where several NFL team personnel evaluate the league's QBs using a simple rubric. From [the 2021 edition](https://theathletic.com/2727336/2021/07/28/2021-nfl-quarterback-tiers-50-coaches-and-evaluators-rank-the-leagues-starters/):

> TIER 1  
> A Tier 1 quarterback can carry his team each week. The team wins because of him. He expertly handles pure passing situations. He has no real holes in his game...
>
> TIER 2  
> A Tier 2 quarterback can carry his team sometimes but not as consistently. He can handle pure passing situations in doses and/or possesses other dimensions that are special enough to elevate him above Tier 3. He has a hole or two in his game...
>
> TIER 3  
> A Tier 3 quarterback is a legitimate starter but needs a heavier running game and/or defensive component to win. A low-volume dropback passing offense suits him best...
>
> TIER 4  
> A Tier 4 quarterback could be an unproven player with some upside or a veteran who is ultimately best suited as a backup...
>
> --- Mike Sando

I really like the tier approach: it aggregates subject matter expert opinion in a straightforward, meaningful way without requiring a false level of precision.

## Time Average Lead + QB Quality Model

A summary of the model, fit on regular season games that occured between 2013 and 2020.

* In addition to the game's time average lead, a team's Sando QB Tier advantage is included as a feature in a logistic regression.
  * I've assumed that the following year's QB Tier is a better indicator of QB quality for a season than their preseason QB Tier.
    * This has the tradeoff of reducing the size of the data set.
    * If one of the QBs is not evaluated the next season (e.g., retires), that game is not included in the data set.
* For each game, the QB tier rating for QB with the most snap counts played for each team is used.
* For an unranked QB that was the planned opening day starter, I assumed a QB rank of 4.0.
* For an unranked QB that was not a planned opening day starter, I assumed a QB rank of 4.5.

## End of Season 2021 Tier Rankings

Using (1) the logistic model above and (2) some estimates I made of the Sando QB Tier grade of the QBs that finished the season (i.e., not L. Jackson for BAL, Big Ben rated Tier 3.5 vice 2.64 from 2021 grades), I made a plot of an end of season power ranking based on a team's season time average lead and QB quality. 

The contour lines represent the model's expected win probability ("exp_wp" in table) against an average team with an average QB. From the plot, think end of season Cleveland Browns led by an injury-plagued Baker Mayfield as roughly representing the baseline.
