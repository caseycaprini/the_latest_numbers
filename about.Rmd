This blog might well contain explorations of sports questions using data.<br>

WARNING: I'm an amateur in every sense applicable.  I've always liked sports and math.  My expertise, if existent, is in the area of nuclear power plant operations.<br>
<br>
Baseball was my first love.  With less disposable time, I've drifted to the NFL.  I've lived most of my life in southwestern PA.  Therefore, I'm an honest-to-goodness Pirates fan that also likes the Steelers and Penguins.<br>
<br>
I didn't write a line of code from 2007 until 2019, when I was introduced to R and the tidyverse.  This blog contains byproducts of my attempts at learning.

### Blog Name
This blog's title is a hat tip to the band [toe](https://www.toe.st/).  I'm indebted to the YouTube algorithm for the introduction.<br>
